                <h2>What is the Linux-Shell?</h2>
                <p>The linux-shell is a component of the "gnu/linux"-os (operating-system), which is the outermost part
                    of
                    the
                    os and could therefore be called the: "interface" of the os.</p>
                <p>"gnu/linux" is normally composed of the following parts:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Hardware</li>
                    <li>Kernel</li>
                    <li>Shell</li>
                    <li>CLI/GUI</li>
                    <li>Applications</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Hardware and kernel can only be accessed through the interface of the shell.</p>
                <p>And as shown through the seventh list-element, the shell can either be accessed through a cli
                    (command-line-interface), or a gui (graphical user-interface).</p>
                <p>The "gnu/linux"-os can be configured to boot into a cli, but it is more common to boot into a gui and
                    then
                    use a terminal-emulator-application in order to access the cli-shell; this is also the way shown in
                    this introduction.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="chapter">
                <h2>Accessing the Linux-Shell.</h2>
                <p>This introduction focuses on beginners and therefore is going to assume that it's reader is using a
                    standard
                    "gnu/linux"-desktop-environment, which ships with a terminal-emulator already installed (like GNOME
                    on
                    Ubuntu).</p>
                <h3>Using the System-Search</h3>
                <p>In order to open a terminal-emulator via the system-search-tool, press the: "Meta"-key (colloquial
                    often
                    called
                    the: "Windows"-key, or on a Mac-keyboard, it should be the: "option"-key").</p>
                <div class="image-row">
                    <img src="img/meta_key_high_res.png" alt="meta_key"/>
                    <img src="img/windows_key_high_res.png" alt="windows_key"/>
                    <img src="img/option_key_high_res.png" alt="option_key"/>
                </div>
                <p>This should open the system-search.</p>
                <p>Then type in something like: "ter", "term" or "terminal".</p>
                <div class="image-row">
                    <img src="img/system_search.png" alt="system_search"/>
                    <img src="img/system_search_terminal.png" alt="system_search_terminal"/>
                </div>
                <p>Which should result in the os-search finding an application with terminal in its name; open it.</p>
                <h3>Using the Start-/Applications-menu</h3>
                <p>Open the start-/applications-menu through the designated button in the task-bar.</p>
                <p>Manually search for a program with: "terminal" in its name and open it.</p>
                <div class="image-row">
                    <img src="img/applications_menu_button.png" alt="applications_menu_button"/>
                    <img src="img/applications_menu.png" alt="applications_menu"/>
                </div>
                <p>(If your desktop-environment uses preconfigured folders in the start-/applications-menu, search in
                    the: "tools"-, or "accessorizes"-folder.)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="chapter">
                <h2>Navigating the Linux-Shell</h2>
                <p>Before every command which can be typed in at the position of the caret, is a prefix in the following
                    format:
                </p>
                <pre>
    "[user]@[computer-name]:[path]$"</pre>
                <p>This is so, because it is possible to change the logged-in user inside the terminal-emulator, while
                    the same user remains logged in inside the gui of the desktop-environment; it is also possible to
                    access other machines via tools like: "ssh" and therefore the computer-name would change according
                    to that.</p>
                <p>And lastly the "path"-part shows the current working directory, from the root, or the home-directory
                    of a specific user onwards.</p>
                <h3>Basic Commands</h3>
                <p>The following commands are the most elemental commands which are needed to explore and learn the
                    linux-shell.</p>
                <p>For the start, they are all which are really needed for basic exploration and learning, and they are
                    also going to serve as examples for further explanations.</p>
                <h4>ls</h4>
                <p><kbd>ls</kbd> stands for: "list".</p>
                <p>It is used in the following way:</p>
                <pre>
    yxnill@codejam:~$ <kbd>ls</kbd>
    <samp>projects scripts secret_stuff_ssshhhh</samp>
    yxnill@codejam:~$</pre>
                <p>In other words, it can just be typed in the command-line, and after pressing return, it is going to
                    list
                    all
                    non-hidden files and folders in the current working directory (the directory the cli is focused on
                    right
                    now).</p>
                <p>This command can be used in order to see which directories are available for navigation and which
                    files
                    are
                    available for reading, editing or executing.</p>
                <h4>pwd</h4>
                <p><kbd>pwd</kbd> stands for: "print working directory".</p>
                <p>It is used in the following way:</p>
                <pre>
    yxnill@codejam:~$ <kbd>pwd</kbd>
    <samp>/home/yxnill</samp></pre>
                <p>It prints the absolute path (the path from the root-directory to the current working directory), into
                    the console.</p>
                <p>This command may be used to navigate the directory-hierarchy, by being able to know where the current
                    working directory is positioned.</p>
                <h4>cd</h4>
                <p><kbd>cd</kbd> stands for: "change directory".</p>
                <p>It is used in the following way:</p>
                <pre>
    yxnill@codejam:~/projects$ <kbd>cd [dirname]</kbd></pre>
                <br>
                <pre>
    yxnill@codejam:~$ <kbd>ls</kbd>
    <samp>projects scripts secret_stuff_ssshhhh</samp>
    yxnill@codejam:~$ <kbd>cd projects</kbd>
    yxnill@codejam:~/projects$</pre>
                <p>So typing: "<kbd>ls</kbd>", is going to list all the non-hidden directories and then these can be
                    traversed by using: "<kbd>cd</kbd>".</p>
                <p>Typing: "<kbd>cd ..</kbd>" results in going back in the directory-hierarchy.</p>
                <pre>
    yxnill@codejam:~/projects$ <kbd>cd ..</kbd>
    yxnill@codejam:~$</pre>
                <p>A single dot represents the current working directory.</p>
                <p>Tilde represents the home-directory.</p>
                <p>Multiple directories can be traversed at once in the following way:</p>
                <pre>
    yxnill@codejam:~$ <kbd>cd ./[dirname]/[dirname]</kbd></pre>
                <br>
                <pre>
    yxnill@codejam:~$ <kbd>cd ./projects/linux_shell_introduction</kbd>
    yxnill@codejam:~/projects/linux_shell_introduction$ <kbd>cd ~</kbd>
    yxnill@codejam:~$</pre>

                <h2>Getting Help</h2>
                <p>While exploring the shell, it is more important to know how to gather unknown information about the
                    shell, rather than knowing how to use the shell 100% of the time.</p>
                <p>What this means is: it is important to know how to use the shell's help-system and external sources,
                    like web-searches.</p>
                <p>It would be wrong to think memorizing all the commands and remembering them at all time is how to use
                    the shell, this is not how it works.</p>
                <p>Of course, it is not going to be difficult remembering often used commands and options, but when
                    familiarization with the shell's help-system and how to create effective web search-queries
                    concerning the shell has been established, the potential for using the shell in an autonomous, quick
                    and precise manner greatly increases.</p>
                <h3>-h, --help and options</h3>
                <p>Nearly every shell-command has a so called: "option", called: "<kbd>-h</kbd>" and/or:
                    "<kbd>--help</kbd>".</p>
                <p>If it is typed in like this:</p>
                <pre>
    yxnill@codejam:~$ <kbd>[command] --help</kbd></pre>
                <p>the shell is going to display a printout of the
                    usage,
                    description and most important options of the command.</p>
                <p>(Options are modifiers of a command's functionality, which are usually initiated by typing them after
                    the name of the command, like described above with the help-option.)</p>
                <p>Here is an example:</p>
                <pre>
    yxnill@codejam:~$ <kbd>ls --help</kbd>
    <samp>Usage: ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...
    List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).
    Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified.

    Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
    -a, --all                  do not ignore entries starting with .
    -A, --almost-all           do not list implied . and ..
    --author               with -l, print the author of each file
    -b, --escape               print C-style escapes for nongraphic characters
    --block-size=SIZE      with -l, scale sizes by SIZE when printing them;
    e.g., '--block-size=M'; see SIZE format below
    -B, --ignore-backups       do not list implied entries ending with ~
    ...</samp>
    yxnill@codejam:~$</pre>
                <p>There are many more options only for ls, which are not listed above: but here is a helpful example of
                    using options:</p>
                <pre>
    yxnill@codejam:~$ <kbd>ls -hla</kbd>
    <samp>total 48K
    drwxrwxr-x  5 yxnill yxnill 4,0K Aug 13 18:40 .
    drwxrwxr-x 13 yxnill yxnill 4,0K Aug 11 18:35 ..
    drwxrwxr-x  8 yxnill yxnill 4,0K Aug 13 15:32 .profile
    -rw-rw-r--  1 yxnill yxnill   10 Aug 11 19:50 .bashrc
    drwxrwxr-x  2 yxnill yxnill 4,0K Aug 13 18:36 .super_secret_stuff_ssshhhh
    drwxrwxr-x  2 yxnill yxnill 4,0K Aug 13 05:40 projects
    -rw-rw-r--  1 yxnill yxnill 2,7K Aug 13 15:25 scripts
    -rw-rw-r--  1 yxnill yxnill  14K Aug 13 18:40 secret_stuff_ssshhhh</samp></pre>
                <p>These options also show hidden files and directories, through the "<kbd>-a</kbd>"-option, which
                    stands
                    for: "all",
                    show a long description about all files and directories, by using the "<kbd>-l</kbd>"-option, which
                    stands for:
                    "long"
                    and make the size of the files and directories human-readable, by using the "<kbd>-h</kbd>"-option,
                    which stands
                    for: "human-readable".</p>
                <p>In the example above, all options are also combined, so they are written as: <kbd>-hla</kbd>, which
                    is a common technique for the shorthand versions of any option (although not every option provides
                    this usage, as some options require for example: arguments of their own).</p>
                <p>The longhand options don't provide this technique, but are a bit more readable, they are also listed
                    in the <kbd>--help</kbd>-printouts.</p>
                <p>For example: the longhand for the "<kbd>-a</kbd>"-option is: "<kbd>--all</kbd>".</p>
                <h3>man</h3>
                <p><kbd>man</kbd> unlike: "<kbd>-h</kbd>" and: "<kbd>--help</kbd>" is its own command and takes a name
                    of
                    another command as an argument
                    (like <kbd>cd</kbd> takes a directory-name as an argument), in order to display a detailed man-page.
                </p>
                <p>This man-page is displayed in a separate terminal-view and allows scrolling through it with the
                    arrow-keys.</p>
                <p>This view can be left by pressing the: "<kbd>q</kbd>"-key.</p>
                <p>Search-queries can be entered by typing: "<kbd>/</kbd>", then typing in the word information is
                    needed for and lastly pressing "<kbd>return</kbd>".</p>
                <pre>
    yxnill@codejamn:~$ <kbd>man ls</kbd>
    <samp>LS(1)                                                                                                User Commands                                                                                               LS(1)

    NAME
           ls - list directory contents

    SYNOPSIS
           ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...

    DESCRIPTION
           List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).  Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified.


           Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

           -a, --all
                  do not ignore entries starting with .

           -A, --almost-all
                  do not list implied . and ..

           --author
                  with -l, print the author of each file

           -b, --escape
                  print C-style escapes for nongraphic characters

    yxnill@codejam:~$</pre>
                <h3>Web-Searching</h3>
                <p>As already mentioned above, there is absolutely no shame in using web-searches if a command is not
                    known,
                    or even if the: "<kbd>--help</kbd>"-option or man-page-printouts of a command don't seem completely
                    decipherable (which is going to change the more you get used to using the shell's help-system).</p>
                <p>Even people who use the linux-shell a lot don't know all commands and/or all their options, or how to
                    combine them.</p>
                <p>So if, after reading this introduction, there would be a situation where (for example) a file, or a
                    directory needs
                    to be created; it would be a valid solution to use a search-query, like the following in a
                    search-engine of trust: "linux shell create file" or "linux shell create directory".</p>
                <p>Which would then lead to websites which are probably going to show that the: "<kbd>touch</kbd>"-command
                    is going to do the trick here for files and the "<kbd>mkdir</kbd>"-command for directories.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>To summarize which information was just conveyed:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Knowledge about linux-os-structure and where the shell fits in there.</li>
                    <li>Knowledge of how to access the linux-shell.</li>
                    <li>Knowledge of the most elemental commands to navigate the shell.</li>
                    <li>Knowledge of the linux-shell's help-system and what options are.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>These basics give a good elemental understanding to build on, because information on how
                    to navigate the shell, and about how to use it's help-system (if a new functionality needs to be
                    learned) are going to translate into an autonomous ability to improve shell related user-skills.</p>
                <p>Lastly, here are some suggestions for further reading about topics which are going to build on the
                    information just conveyed here:</p>
                <ul>
