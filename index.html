        <h1>Linux-Shell-Introduction</h1>
        <h2>What is the Linux-Shell?</h2>
        <p>The linux-shell is a component of the "gnu/linux"-operating-system, which is the interface of the os.</p>
        <p>"gnu/linux" is normally composed of the following parts:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Hardware</li>
            <li>Kernel</li>
            <li>Operating-System</li>
            <li>Shell</li>
            <li>CLI/GUI</li>
            <li>Applications</li>
        </ol>
        <p>As shown through the seventh list-element, the shell can either be accessed through a cli
            (command-line-interface), or a gui (graphical user-interface)</p>
        <p>One can configure the "gnu/linux"-os to boot into a cli, but it is more common to boot into a gui and
            then use a terminal-emulator-application in order to access the shell via a cli.</p>
        <p>This website is going to focus on an introduction to using the linux-shell via the cli.</p>
        <h2>Accessing the Linux-Shell.</h2>
        <p>This introduction focuses on beginners and therefore is going to assume that it's reader is using a standard
            "gnu/linux"-desktop-environment, which ships with a terminal-emulator already installed (like GNOME).</p>
        <h3>Using the System-Search</h3>
        <p>In order to open a terminal-emulator via the system-search-tool, press the: "Meta"-key (colloquial often
            called
            the: "Windows"-key, or on a Mac-keyboard, it should be the: "option"-key").</p>
        <p>This should open the system-search.</p>
        <p>Then type in something like: "ter", "term" or "terminal".</p>
        <p>Which should result in the os-search finding an application with terminal in its name; open it.</p>
        <h3>Using the Start-/Applications-menu</h3>
        <p>Open the start-/applications-menu through the designated button in your task-bar.</p>
        <p>Search for a program with: "terminal" in its name and open it.</p>
